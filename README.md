# timcol

**Tim**~~e~~ **cl**~~i~~ (with an **o** thrown in) is a time tracker for the forgetful.

Features of `timcol` include

* A screenshotter to help you figure out when you started/stopped a task if you forgot to log your time.
* An output format that's compatible with [ledger-cli](https://www.ledger-cli.org).
* An entry point that starts up a pre-split `screen` session with the screenshotter's output, recent timelog entries, and a convenient shell for logging them.
